/*Coding Challenge #1
Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
and height in meter).
Your tasks:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
Test data:
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall.
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall

const markMass=95,markHeight=1.88,johnMass=85,johnHeight=1.76;


const markBMI=markMass / (markHeight * markHeight);
console.log("Mark BMI"+":"+markBMI);

const johnBMI =johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
console.log("John BMI"+":"+johnBMI);

const markHigherBMI= (markBMI>johnBMI)? true:false;
console.log(markHigherBMI);*/

Coding Challenge #2
Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and
improve it.
Your tasks:
1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message
is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

const markMass=95,markHeight=1.88,johnMass=85,johnHeight=1.76;

const markBMI=markMass / (markHeight * markHeight);
console.log("Mark BMI"+":"+markBMI);

const johnBMI =johnMass / (johnHeight * johnHeight);
console.log("John BMI"+":"+johnBMI);

if(markBMI>johnBMI){
    console.log(`Mark's BMI is higher than John's! , Mark's
    BMI  ${markBMI} is higher than John's ${johnBMI}`);
}
else{
    console.log(`John's BMI is higher than Mark's!, John's
    BMI  ${johnBMI} is higher than Mark's ${markBMI}`);
}
const markHigherBMI= (markBMI>johnBMI)? true:false;
console.log(markHigherBMI);*/
